# Guac

Local desktop app. You talk to LLM agents; the agents talk to each other. Tauri
v2, React + TypeScript front, Rust back.

## Non-obvious things worth knowing before you change something

**The agent runtime is Rust, not the webview.** Each agent is a `tokio` task
with an `mpsc` inbox. If you find yourself adding agent logic to `src/`, you are
in the wrong half of the repo. The frontend renders state and forwards intent.

**Read `runtime/guard.rs` before touching anything about messaging.** Agents
messaging each other does not terminate on its own. Five independent limits stop
it, and each catches a different shape of runaway. Weakening one is not a local
change.

**`expects_reply` is what makes cascades converge**, not the guard. The guard is
the backstop. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Budget counts model calls, not agent turns.** One turn can make several calls
working through tool results. Counting turns lets a bounded run bill many times
over. There is a test named after this.

**Anything crossing IPC is camelCase.** `rename_all` on a tagged enum renames
variants, not fields; you also need `rename_all_fields`. `ipc.contract.test.ts`
compares the Rust and TypeScript command lists directly, so a rename that only
lands on one side fails the build rather than at runtime.

**`Store::open` has two SQLite lessons encoded in comments.** Do not reorder the
pragmas or simplify the migration transaction without reading them.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding code. Comments explain why, never what.
- Every guard refusal and every error the operator can hit says what happened
  and what to do about it. Both are read by a model or a human under pressure.
- New behaviour needs a test that would fail without it. Failure paths first.
- No dead code, no speculative API surface. The contract test fails on a command
  nothing calls.

## Verify

```sh
./scripts/ci.sh          # lint, typecheck, build, both test suites
./scripts/ci.sh rust     # Rust only
GUAC_LOG=guac=debug pnpm app
```

The Rust suite includes cascade tests that drive the real runtime against a
scripted OpenAI-compatible server. If you change messaging, they are the ones
that will catch you.
